    "This project implements a learning agent for Rummikub using the **MaskablePPO** version of the **PPO** algorithm. The environment was implemented in **Python**, and the game engine was implemented in **C++** for performance reasons. The program allows for training the model for multiple players with different block ranges and starting numbers. The model can also be tested in a game with both a human and a computer.\n",

   "source": "As we can see, the model runs very quickly and is able to play the entire game in a fraction of a second. However, the problem begins for games with a larger range of tiles, as the number of possible combinations grows even faster than exponentially. The engine must find all possible moves in a given setup to calculate the mask. Several optimizations are applied to speed up the entire process, counting only the setups that have a chance of being correct and counting different possibilities in parallel across different threads, but the entire process is still very demanding on the computer. Therefore, training a model that can learn to play the full pool of 13 different tiles plus jokers requires a very powerful computer and a significant amount of time.",
